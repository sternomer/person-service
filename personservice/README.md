# CRUD Operations in MongoDB with gRPC using Go 

Featuring: 

* [MongoDB official Go driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver)
* [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) client and server stubs in golang
* Client CLI tool made with [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)


** Note: Cobra does not yet work with go modules for generating subcommands, you'll have to dig GOPATH out of its grave if you want to use the generator tool.

** Todo: 
* Go Modules
* Code cleanup
